for the tokenHelper 
there are 1.access token -> memory/localStorage
          2.Refresh token -> httpOnly cookie save from XSS
           these tokens are used for identify and authorize the user

After user succefully logged in then this tokenHelper function create a token,refreshtoken
that willbe used for backend authenticate the future request

to get the token we need jwt -> we get it from the github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go
        this jwt has this jwt.Strandclaims that will give us the expiry and issur etc..




for the signup function in usercontroller we need the ctx,cancel as they used for MONGODB operation need the context(ctx)
After the 100 seconds auto cancel -> revent the request hanging forever
